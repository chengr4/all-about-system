# Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)

Def.

- Register: A data storage location
- Instruction: A "control phrase" for a computer, for example `ADD` to add or `MOVE` to transfer information.
- Operands: An input or output value for an instruction, for example, :"Move the data in register X to register Y" would have one input register operand and one output register operand.

- RISC machines have a much smaller set of instructions at the ISA level

# IA-32

The IA-32 arch can run in three modes:

1. Protected Mode(Native)
    - Each running program is reserved a linear address space in memory of 4GB
    - programs aren’t allowed to access each others’ allocated memory space. 
    - Windows and Linux run in this mode.
2. Real-Address Mode
    - Compatible with legacy programs written for the Intel 8086 processor family
    - 
3. System Management Mode (SMM)
    - The processor will switch to a separate address space so vital memory isn’t affected.

### Registers

> they’re even faster (and smaller) than L1 cache.

- Changes made to these sub-registers are reflected in the larger register, so be careful.
